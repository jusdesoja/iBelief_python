# iBelief_python

## A python module for calculation in Dempster-Shafer theory
### Functions
This module includes calculation methods in DST. 
Following major fonctions are included for the moment:
1. Fast Mobius Transformation (FMT) on mass functions (Philippe Smet's version) 
2. Main stream combination rules over mass functions
3. Conflict & Distance calculation between mass functions
4. DST-based machine learning rules:
  * Evidential c-means
It is currently maintained by a several members in team CPSS of Hainan University.

### Dependency
Code is valid only on python 3.
The calculation is implemented with matrix calculation, depending on [numpy](https://numpy.org), [scipy](https://www.scipy.org), [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org)
